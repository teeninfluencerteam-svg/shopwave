# Google Apps Script Error Fix

## Issue
Error: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON`

This error occurs when the Google Apps Script API returns HTML instead of JSON, typically indicating:
1. The Google Apps Script URL is incorrect or placeholder
2. The script is not properly deployed
3. The script has an error or requires authentication

## Solution Applied

### 1. Improved Error Handling
- Added content-type checking before parsing JSON
- Added better logging to identify non-JSON responses
- Added graceful fallback to sample data

### 2. Multi-tier Fallback System
```
1. Google Apps Script API (primary)
   ↓ (if fails)
2. Local Next.js API (/api/products) (secondary)
   ↓ (if fails)  
3. Sample Data (final fallback)
```

### 3. Configuration Updates
- Commented out placeholder Google Apps Script URL in `.env.local`
- Added check for missing API URL configuration
- Added detailed logging for debugging

## How to Fix Completely

### Option 1: Configure Google Apps Script (Recommended)
1. Create a Google Apps Script project
2. Deploy it as a web app with public access
3. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPS_SCRIPT_API_URL` in `.env.local` with the real deployment URL
4. Restart the development server

### Option 2: Use Local API Only
1. Keep the Google Apps Script URL commented out
2. The app will automatically use local sample data
3. All CRUD operations will work with local storage

### Option 3: Integrate with Database
1. Replace Google Apps Script with a database (Supabase, Firebase, etc.)
2. Update the API endpoints to use the database
3. Configure database connection in environment variables

## Current Status
✅ Error handling improved
✅ Fallback system implemented
✅ Application continues to work with sample data
✅ Admin panel functions properly with local data

The application now gracefully handles the Google Apps Script error and provides a seamless user experience with sample data until the external API is properly configured.
