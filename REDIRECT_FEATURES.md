# Auto Google Sign-in & Smart Redirect Features

## New Features Added âœ…

### 1. Auto Google One Tap Sign-in
- **Smart Display**: Shows Google One Tap popup automatically after 2 seconds
- **Smart Timing**: Only shows on non-auth pages
- **User Friendly**: Remembers if user dismissed it (won't show for 24 hours)
- **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't auto-select, lets user choose

### 2. Smart Redirect System
- **Save Current Path**: Automatically saves where user was before login
- **Return After Login**: Takes user back to exact same page after successful login
- **Query Parameters**: Preserves search parameters and filters
- **Exclude Auth Pages**: Doesn't save auth pages as redirect targets

## How It Works

### Before Login:
1. User visits any page (e.g., `/product/some-product`)
2. User clicks "Add to Cart" or any action requiring auth
3. System saves current path: `/product/some-product`
4. User gets redirected to `/sign-in`

### After Login:
1. User completes Google/email sign-in
2. System checks for saved path
3. User gets redirected back to `/product/some-product`
4. User can continue their original action

### Google One Tap:
1. Shows automatically on any page (except auth pages)
2. Appears after 2 seconds of page load
3. If dismissed, won't show again for 24 hours
4. Saves current page before redirecting to sign-in

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- âœ… `src/hooks/use-redirect.ts` - New redirect hook
- âœ… `src/hooks/use-require-auth.ts` - Updated to save current path
- âœ… `src/context/ClerkAuthContext.tsx` - Added redirect after login
- âœ… `src/components/GoogleOneTap.tsx` - Improved auto sign-in
- âœ… `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` - Better redirect handling
- âœ… `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added GoogleOneTap component

### Key Features:
```typescript
// Saves current path before login
localStorage.setItem('redirectAfterAuth', currentPath)

// Redirects after successful login
const savedPath = localStorage.getItem('redirectAfterAuth')
if (savedPath) {
  router.push(savedPath)
  localStorage.removeItem('redirectAfterAuth')
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- User on product page â†’ Login â†’ Goes to home page â†’ Has to find product again

### Google One Tap Benefits:
- **Faster Login**: One-click Google sign-in
- **Smart Display**: Only shows when relevant
- **Non-Annoying**: Respects user dismissal
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works perfectly on phones
